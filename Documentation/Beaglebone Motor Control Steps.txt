Steps to use the Beaglebone and T6 Stepper driver during testing phase:

1. Connect Beaglebone to a computer via the MicroUSB-USB cable. This is both power the Beaglebone, and establish a RNDIS device on you laptop. This allows you to connect to
the Beaglebone as if you were connected via ethernet.

2. Connect the Beaglebone to the stepper driver using the ethernet cable. The RJ45 connector will be inserted into either port CN4 or CN5 on the stepper driver. The other end
will be wired to the Beaglebone like so:
Orange/White: RS485 A
Solid Orange: RS485 B
Solid Brown: GND

3. Open PuTTY or other SSH application of your choice.

4. Connect to the Beaglebone with the IP: 192.168.7.2

5. You will be prompted to sign-in. Use:
Name: debian
Pass: temppwd

6. In the directory /home/debian (This is currently the default directory) you will see several programs and scripts I've been experimenting with. Run:
./pinconfig.sh
python Writer.py

This configures the UART4 port on the Beaglebone, and starts a script to send commands to the stepper driver. The stepper will need to be set up and powered on from this point.

7. Send commands to the driver in the following format: XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX
Each pair of symbols represents a byte using it's hexadecimal form. Examples of these byte strings can be found starting on page 132 of the full documentation.

8. Exit the program by typing "exit"
