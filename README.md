# ECEN4024 Capstone Project

This repo contains all software related to the development of our 1-DOF motion platform ocean simulator capstone project, sponsored by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in conjunction with Oklahoma State University.

1. A GUI interface for a user to interact with our motion platform, in the form of either inputing manual positioning, or uploading pre-computed motion data.
2. An backend program that will divide the heave motion between our platform and the pre-build hexapod.
3. A motor controller program that will run on Beaglebone Black, relaying motor movement commands from the backend to the individual motors.

Insert info from CDR here after finished.
